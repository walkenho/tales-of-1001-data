# How to use fastai, Gradio and HuggingFace to Save an Ugly Duckling from a Youth of Misery - Training and deploying an image classifier in less than 30 lines of code 

Hans Christian Andersenâ€™s tale of the ugly duckling tells us about a cygnet (i.e. a baby swan) brought up as part of a family of ducks and being bullied by its siblings and everybody else for being ugly (read different to them). If only the poor cygnet had had somebody to tell it that it in fact was a swan instead! Entering Our Hero, Machine Learning to the rescue!

This project demonstrates how to use fastai, Gradio and HuggingFace to build a magic mirror that can distinguish a duckling from a cygnet in four main steps. Then we will deploy it to the internet for all ducklings out there to use. We will learn how to:

1. Create a dataset from scratch, using a duckduckgo image search.
2. Train a train a computer vision model using fastai.
3. Build a magic mirror app using Gradio.
4. Deploy the magic mirror for free on HuggingFace.

The final app can be found at [Jessica's ugly-duckling-magic-mirror HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/walkenho/ugly-duckling-magic-mirror).
